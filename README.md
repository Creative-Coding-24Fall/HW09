For 2024F 6063B [HW09](https://6063b.github.io/homework/09/#/programming)

For HW09B, I originally wanted to design a filter once your do the Añjali Mudrā （putting palms together for praying the buddha light will appears. However it was hard to figuring out how to recognize the distance between two palms and once I figured it out, the webpage got super slow till it stopped working. Therefore I changed it to mouth movement.

open your mouth for the buddha light!!! As if you are saying Om!
